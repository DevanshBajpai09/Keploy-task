## üß™ Testing Strategy

### ‚úÖ Unit Tests (`__test__/unit`)
Test utility functions like `cn()` and `getTypeVariant()` for correctness.

### üîó Integration Tests (`__test__/integration`)
Tests Prisma and DB interaction directly by:
- Inserting test data
- Cleaning up after each test

### üåê API Tests (`__test__/api`)
Simulates real HTTP requests to:
- POST `/api/notifications`
- Validates response code and body

# Full-Stack Notification Service

This is a full-stack notification service built with a modern web development stack. The project allows users to receive different types of notifications (In-app, Email, SMS) and provides APIs to send, view, update, and delete notifications. The backend uses **PostgreSQL**, **NeonDB**, **RabbitMQ**, and **Twilio**, while the frontend is built using **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, **Shadcn UI**, and **React Icons**.

## Features

- **In-app notifications** for user interactions.
- **Email notifications** using **Resend**.
- **SMS notifications** using **Twilio API**.
- API endpoints to **send**, **view**, **update**, and **delete** notifications.
- Responsive and interactive frontend with **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Shadcn UI**.
- Real-time updates with **RabbitMQ** message queue.
- Fully functional user interface with **React Icons** for icons.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Server-side environment to handle API requests.
- **Next.js**: Full-stack React framework used for building both frontend and backend.
- **Prisma ORM**: For interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
- **PostgreSQL/NeonDB**: Relational database to store notification data.
- **RabbitMQ**: Message queue for handling notification events asynchronously.
- **Twilio**: For sending SMS and email notifications via their respective APIs.

### Frontend
- **Next.js**: Full-stack React framework.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for building responsive and styled components.
- **Shadcn UI**: A design system for building clean and customizable UI components.
- **React Icons**: For adding icons to UI components.

### APIs
- **`/api/notifications`**: Endpoint for sending notifications.
- **`/api/user/[id]/notifications`**: Endpoint for viewing notifications of a specific user.
- **`/api/user/[id]/update`**: Endpoint to update a notification message.
- **`/api/user/[id]/delete`**: Endpoint to delete a specific notification.

# API Dcumeetation

## Overview
The application exposes several API endpoints to interact with notifications. These endpoints allow you to send notifications, retrieve notifications for a specific user, and mark notifications as read. The system supports In-app, Email, and SMS notifications. Below is a detailed documentation of the available APIs.

## Base URL
The base URL for all API endpoints is:

```bash 
http://localhost:3000/api
```

## 1. Send Notification

POST /api/notifications
This endpoint is used to send a new notification (In-app, Email, or SMS) to a user.

Request Body:

```bash 
{
  "userId": "string",      // The user ID to whom the notification will be sent.
  "message": "string",     // The content of the notification.
  "type": "string",        // The type of notification. It can be one of: "inapp", "email", "sms".
  "email": "string",       // (Optional) The email address for sending email notifications.
  "phoneNumber": "string"  // (Optional) The phone number for sending SMS notifications.
}
```

Response:

```bash 
{
  "success": true,                 // Whether the notification was successfully enqueued.
  "notification": {                // The notification data that was sent.
    "id": "1234",
    "userId": "string",
    "message": "string",
    "type": "inapp",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }

```

## 2. Get User Notifications
GET /api/user/[id]/notifications
This endpoint retrieves all notifications for a specific user. Notifications are returned in descending order based on the creation date.

URL Parameters:
id (required): The ID of the user for whom the notifications are being fetched.

Response:

```bash 
{
  "notifications": [
    {
      "id": "1234",
      "userId": "string",
      "message": "string",
      "type": "inapp",
      "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"

      "type": "email",
      "createdAt": "2025-01-02T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}

```

## 3. Mark Notifications as Read

PATCH /api/user/[id]/notifications
This endpoint marks notifications as read for a specific user. You can either mark all unread notifications as read or mark a specific notification as read by providing its notificationId.

URL Parameters:
id (required): The ID of the user whose notifications are being updated.

Request Body (optional):
notificationId (optional): The ID of the notification to mark as read. If not provided, all unread notifications for the user will be marked as read.
